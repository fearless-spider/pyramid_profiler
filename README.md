# Pyramid Profiler - not ready yet

Pyramid_profiler measures endpoints defined in your pyramid application; and provides you fine-grained report through a web interface.

It gives answers to these questions:

* Where are the bottlenecks in my application?
* Which endpoints are the slowest in my application?
* Which are the most frequently called endpoints?
* What causes my slow endpoints? In which context, with what args and kwargs are they slow?
* How much time did a specific request take?

In short, if you are curious about what your endpoints are doing and what requests they are receiving, give a try to pyramid_profiler.

With pyramid_profiler's web interface, you can monitor all your endpoints' performance and investigate endpoints and received requests by drilling down through filters.
